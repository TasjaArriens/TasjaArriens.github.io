# Who it is for

The book is a nice to read for people who struggle with getting things done. 
They tell you how tired they are and that it is not the right day, but Patrik helps you to understand how you can achieve actually everything - if you're feeling like doing it or not.
If you want to be more productive throughout your days and have not yet read a book like this, I can recommend it.

# Summary

All in all, it is a nice book to get an overview of different methods to finally get your things done. 
Since I already read books before, it had not much new information for me, but some points were quiet nice and I will try to implement them in my own life.

## Habit #1: Sleep

You might already know it, but here it is again: sleep is important if you want to perform good throughout the whole day.
Patrik explains that you should try to sleep 7.5 - 9 hours per night, but of course have to find the right length for yourself.


### Action Steps

You might sleep best, when your room is dark, cold, and quiet.
Furthermore, you should drink no coffee after noon and never use tobacco.
3 hours before bedtime, you should not do heavy workouts or eat.

To optimize your sleep, you could establish your "Personal Sleep Quotient" and develop a pre-sleep ritual.

What I find most important and he does also mention it, is that many people underrate the recurring sleeping pattern.
You do have an internal sleep-wake clock and you should stick to it.
There is a point with the discussion about summertime and wintertime.
For our body, altering the sleep rhythm is a quiet big deal.
To be really fit on every morning, you should make sure that you go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day, also on weekends.
Once you established your own sleeping pattern, you will understand. 
And (we will get to this point later again) you can prevent decision fatigue with this little tip.
Keep it in mind!

## Habit #2: Nutrition

You cannot perform at your best, if you eat fast food and other unhealthy stuff on a daily basis.
To be as productive as you want to be, you have to establish a healthy nutrition.
Patrik gives us a nice definition for what to eat:

>"a good nutrient-to-calorie ratio without a lot of the bad stuff"

Furthermore, he helps you to start right now, since he offers a little list of healthy foods.
To implement this new lifestyle, you do not have to change everything over night.
Start with small changes and make sure that you stick to your new behavior.
Changes in your environment can also have a huge effect: hide chocolate and chips, place fruits on the desk, where they are visible.

From my side I would also recommend that you drink enough water or tea.
Do not drink coke or juices, since they contain lots of sugar.
I would also like to recommend intermitting fasting.
It sounds like a stupid diet again, but it helps your brain to perform, too.
I will write an article on this topic later on, so stay tuned!

## Habit #3: Movement

>"Research has found that two months of exercise can be enough to significantly increase the ability to resist temptation and persevere in challenging situations."

This quote from Patrik shows how important it is to exercise on a regular basis.
For me, it helps directly being more motivated to get my stuff done.
I am most productive in mornings and in the evenings after finishing a workout.

But exercising is not enough.
You also need movement, which is getting up from your desk, walking for some minutes, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
Patrik himself cites the philosopher Brian Johnson, who defined micro, mini, and macro movements:
* Micro Movements: dynamic movements instead of static once, like taking the stairs
* Mini Movements: dynamic movements that are slightly longer, like walking for some minutes more
* Macro Movements: exercising

So, what can you change in your life?

1. Establish your own micro, mini, and macro movements and
2. combine themwith a different task by using if-then plans.
3. The environment plays a crucial role again: how can you change it to move more? 
4. Track your movements and try to get a little better every week.

## Habit #4: Mindfulness

Make yourself aware that you have an observing mind and a thinking mind.
What does that mean?
Well, have you ever recognize that you observe yourself while thinking?
There you have the two different minds.
The problem here is that you cannot control your thinking mind, but you can control your observing mind.

By applying mindful meditation, you can start to pay attention on your thoughts without judging.
This can not only help you by decreasing the negativity, but it also allows you to stick to your self-discipline.

Sounds great?
Well then, get started!

* Find a quiet place where you feel comfortable.
* Again you can apply an if-then plan to make sure that you make meditation a habit.
* Start small with only 1 or 2 minutes until it really became a habit.

## Strategy #1: Develop a Growth Mindset

There are two kinds of people: the ones with a fixed mindset and the ones with a growth mindset.
The people with a fixed mindset have the strong opinion that they cannot change things like their intelligence.
They have a desire to **look smart**.
On the other hand, people with a growth mindset believe that dedication and hard work can lead to an improvement of their basic qualities. 
They have a desire to **learn and grow**.

As you can see, your beliefs are very important when it comes to self development.
They can be the limitation to your productivity.
So make sure that even if you hear the inner voice that you still have a choice.
Talk back to yourself, to the inner voice, with a growth mindset and take action!

## Strategy #2: Find Your Mission

In this part, Patrik introduces 'The Hedgehog Concept'.
If you want to succeed, you should focus on one thing only.
To determine which one thing you should put your energy in, you should look what you are interested in, what your skills are, and what the needs of the world are.
The overlap of these three areas is your mission!

The difficult part for the most of you might be finding out what you are good in.
Patrik proposes some ideas that might help you:
* a personality test like Myers-Briggs or the Big Five
* a character strengths test like the VIA Survey
* ask the people that are close to you
* think of which advices you give to people when they ask you for anything.
