# Who it is for

The book is a nice to read for people who struggle with getting things done. 
They tell you how tired they are and that it is not the right day, but Patrik helps you to understand how you can achieve actually everything - if you're feeling like doing it or not.
If you want to be more productive throughout your days and have not yet read a book like this, I can recommend it.

# Summary

All in all, it is a nice book to get an overview of different methods to finally get your things done. 
Since I already read books before, it had not much new information for me, but some points were quiet nice and I will try to implement them in my own life.

## Habit #1: Sleep

You might already know it, but here it is again: sleep is important if you want to perform good throughout the whole day.
Patrik explains that you should try to sleep 7.5 - 9 hours per night, but of course have to find the right length for yourself.


### Action Steps

You might sleep best, when your room is dark, cold, and quiet.
Furthermore, you should drink no coffee after noon and never use tobacco.
3 hours before bedtime, you should not do heavy workouts or eat.

To optimize your sleep, you could establish your "Personal Sleep Quotient" and develop a pre-sleep ritual.

What I find most important and he does also mention it, is that many people underrate the recurring sleeping pattern.
You do have an internal sleep-wake clock and you should stick to it.
There is a point with the discussion about summertime and wintertime.
For our body, altering the sleep rhythm is a quiet big deal.
To be really fit on every morning, you should make sure that you go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day, also on weekends.
Once you established your own sleeping pattern, you will understand. 
And (we will get to this point later again) you can prevent decision fatigue with this little tip.
Keep it in mind!

## Habit #2: Nutrition

You cannot perform at your best, if you eat fast food and other unhealthy stuff on a daily basis.
To be as productive as you want to be, you have to establish a healthy nutrition.
Patrik gives us a nice definition for what to eat:

>"a good nutrient-to-calorie ratio without a lot of the bad stuff"

Furthermore, he helps you to start right now, since he offers a little list of healthy foods.
To implement this new lifestyle, you do not have to change everything over night.
Start with small changes and make sure that you stick to your new behavior.
Changes in your environment can also have a huge effect: hide chocolate and chips, place fruits on the desk, where they are visible.

From my side I would also recommend that you drink enough water or tea.
Do not drink coke or juices, since they contain lots of sugar.
I would also like to recommend intermitting fasting.
It sounds like a stupid diet again, but it helps your brain to perform, too.
I will write an article on this topic later on, so stay tuned!

## Habit #3: Movement

>"Research has found that two months of exercise can be enough to significantly increase the ability to resist temptation and persevere in challenging situations."

This quote from Patrik shows how important it is to exercise on a regular basis.
For me, it helps directly being more motivated to get my stuff done.
I am most productive in mornings and in the evenings after finishing a workout.

But exercising is not enough.
You also need movement, which is getting up from your desk, walking for some minutes, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
Patrik himself cites the philosopher Brian Johnson, who defined micro, mini, and macro movements:
* Micro Movements: dynamic movements instead of static once, like taking the stairs
* Mini Movements: dynamic movements that are slightly longer, like walking for some minutes more
* Macro Movements: exercising

So, what can you change in your life?

1. Establish your own micro, mini, and macro movements and
2. combine themwith a different task by using if-then plans.
3. The environment plays a crucial role again: how can you change it to move more? 
4. Track your movements and try to get a little better every week.

## Habit #4: Mindfulness

Make yourself aware that you have an observing mind and a thinking mind.
What does that mean?
Well, have you ever recognize that you observe yourself while thinking?
There you have the two different minds.
The problem here is that you cannot control your thinking mind, but you can control your observing mind.

By applying mindful meditation, you can start to pay attention on your thoughts without judging.
This can not only help you by decreasing the negativity, but it also allows you to stick to your self-discipline.

Sounds great?
Well then, get started!

* Find a quiet place where you feel comfortable.
* Again you can apply an if-then plan to make sure that you make meditation a habit.
* Start small with only 1 or 2 minutes until it really became a habit.

## Strategy #1: Develop a Growth Mindset

There are two kinds of people: the ones with a fixed mindset and the ones with a growth mindset.
The people with a fixed mindset have the strong opinion that they cannot change things like their intelligence.
They have a desire to **look smart**.
On the other hand, people with a growth mindset believe that dedication and hard work can lead to an improvement of their basic qualities. 
They have a desire to **learn and grow**.

As you can see, your beliefs are very important when it comes to self development.
They can be the limitation to your productivity.
So make sure that even if you hear the inner voice that you still have a choice.
Talk back to yourself, to the inner voice, with a growth mindset and take action!

## Strategy #2: Find Your Mission

In this part, Patrik introduces 'The Hedgehog Concept'.
If you want to succeed, you should focus on one thing only.
To determine which one thing you should put your energy in, you should look what you are interested in, what your skills are, and what the needs of the world are.
The overlap of these three areas is your mission!

The difficult part for the most of you might be finding out what you are good in.
Patrik proposes some ideas that might help you:
* a personality test like Myers-Briggs or the Big Five
* a character strengths test like the VIA Survey
* ask the people that are close to you
* think of which advices you give to people when they ask you for anything.

## Strategy #3: Know Your Why

Patrik explains that people do not buy **what** you do, but **why** you do it.
You can find your why by applying the Golden Circle:
* What: job title, function, the products you sell or the services you offer
* How: actions you take that set you apart from others
* Why: purpose, cause, or belief that inspires you

If you then find your why, it can help you to get the things done.
Your why is the motivation behind, the force that drives you to go on and work.

## Strategy #4: Define Your Circle of Competence

The circle of competence describes what you should focus on.
It uncovers the area in which you can work to be the favourite to win, since it shows where you are good at.
If you know your circle, then you can focus and make the most out of your time and effort.

# Action Steps

You can start by writing down your circle of competence.
Do this by answering the following questions:
* What are the three most important areas I need to focus on?
* Where should I spend my time and effort to align with my why and succeed at my mission?
* What habits do I need to create to strengthen my circle of competence every day?

Then, you can start to schedule time for the habits in your calender.

## Strategy #5: Measure Your Progress

Why?
Well, because what gets measured gets improved.
Patrik keeps it this simple, and I agree.
How do you know that you make progress if you do not measure it?
For habits, the best method to measure your progress is to mark it in a calendar.
In addition, writing down that you sticked to your habit one day more will became a reward.
Then, you must decide on what is your daily minimum for each habit and area in your circle of competence.
Start by keeping it small to ensure that you can reach your goal every day to keep yourself motivated.
Even if there are days when you cannot stick to the habits, you can make rules.
For example, when you get sick you can simply write an 'S' instead of an 'X' and then it is no big deal that you did not reach your goal this day.
Furthermore, you should evaluate your progress on a regular basis.
Why are some chains developing better than others?
Try to figure it out and apply it to other habits to improve them as well.

## Strategy #6: Create a Winner Effect

> [A]n animal that has won a few fights against weak opponents is much more likely to win future confrontations against stronger contenders.

This citation from Patrik is explained by an increase of testosterone and dopamine in the body each time you win.
In addition, the Progress Principle by Teresa Amabile says that making progress in meaningful work is the best booster for motivation during a workday.

How can we profit from this knowledge?

Set goals that are so easy that you are pretty much guaranteed to achieve them.
Patrik refers to them as so called 'Tomato Cans'.
Control your established habits if they are really tomato cans, and if not, transfer them into easier ones.

## Strategy #7: Reward Yourself

Unfortunately, we are way better in punishing ourselves and terrible in rewarding ourselves.
Instead of being proud of what we achieved, we tend to make no big deal out of it.

Believe it or not, but it is very easy to create a Token Economy like B. F. Skinner did himself.

Search for anything that works as tokens for you, like poker chips.
Then, you can create a list with rewards that fit to your longterm goals.
Why longterm goals?
This will keep you motivated and helps you to build the confidence you'll need.
The list will lead you to become the person you identify yourself with.
It might look like this:

* Running socks = 5 tokens
* New sport shirt = 10 tokens
* Fitness tracker = 100 tokens

and so on.

## Strategy #8: Use Commitment Devices

To make sure that you stick to your daily targts, you can use commitment devices that help you to keep track.
There are many apps, strategies, and services that can help you.

While Patrik has his own list he recommends you, I would like to add my own advices here:

* Forest: for me this app did a lot. It helped my while studying to stay off my phone for 25 min, then I did a 5 min break, where I made myself a cup of tea and answered to new messages. After the 5 min break, I started the app again for 25 min, and so on and on. I finally was able to study way more than ever before. In addition, it rewards you with coins and your tree does not die. With the coins you can buy new trees and build a beautiful forest. Don't worry, you don't have to do the 25 min interval, since you can choose between 5 min up to 120 min. And if you need some apps for studying, you can put them onto the white list.
* StayFocused: restricts your time for time-wasting websites.
* SelfControl: controls your time on sites and email servers on the Mac
* Freedom: locks you away from the internet on the Mac

Since I do not have a Mac, I cannot say much about these apps, but as you might recognize I am a big fan of forest.
For me it was a big reward, when I looked at my forest in the evening or the week after.

You are not limited to these apps I mentioned above.
Be creative and search for more apps or strategies that might help to stay focused.

## Strategy #9: Make Marginal Gains

The concept of supercompensation says that after recovery, your body does not go back to its baseline, but will go a little higher, you'll be a little stronger than before.
You can try to apply this concept to your new habits by adding new ones or try to do them longer.

But how to do it without making them so hard that they are no tomato cans anymore?

Patrik recommends to schedule a weekly review.
At this time, you can go through the following steps for every habit:

* Analyze your progress.
* Reward yourself.
* Exchange your tokens.
* Readjust your approach.
* Make marginal gains.

I did not start doing this yet, but I actually planned to increase the meditation time once it is an established habit.
I started with 1 min, but raised it soon to 2 min and now, I am trying to do it every morning.
Let's try to do it as Patrik recommends and see how much progress we'll make!

## Strategy #10: Manage Your Energy

Decision fatigue is a big problem for daily motivation.
You have to make so many small decisions per day, but even if they are small, they cost you energy again and again.
It starts in the morning by deciding what to wear or what to eat.

Try to minimize the decisions you have to make per day.
Maybe you could start to have the same breakfast every day or only 2 or 3 from which you take one.
You can also start to make a list of what to do the next day in the evening before, when you are not going to be productive anymore.
Then you don't have to pay attention on your energy.

You can also rearrange your schedule.
Find out what you are doing best when.
I perform best in a workout in the evening, when my main meal was 2 - 3 hours ago.
My peak in productivity is in the morning, so this is when I try to do the most important things that cost me a lot of my energy.

But you have to figure it out on your own!

## Strategy #11: Protect Your Time

Your time is more important than money if you want to become a better you.
This is why you should protect your time.
Furthermore, you can always get more money, but not more time.

The following list contains steps that will help you to protect your time:

* Cut out TV.
* Limit Internet usage.
* Reorganize your phone.
* Reduce your email.
* Simplify your commitments.
* Say no.

This list by Patrik contains the most important points.
Of course, it depends on you if you have to add something to the list.
Maybe you should take some time to fill the list and individualize it for yourself.

## Strategy #12: Shape Your Environment

Your environment contains many triggers.
Unfortunately, they can prevent you from being productive.
We are some kind of lazy and like to do or choose what we are used to.
Of course, you can try to work against the desire to turn the TV on, which is right in front of you.
But if you think back to Strategy #10, you might see that this would cost you energy that is needed for the actual task you want to focus on.

So just change your environment to help you doing the right things.
Make the desired actions as easy as possible and the undesired as hard as possible.

## Strategy #13: Surround Yourself with the Right People
