## Part A: Predictably Wrong

### 1. Scope Intensity

When people are asked about how much they would pay to save migrating birds or for the protection of wilderness areas, their willingness to pay increases linear even though there is an exponential increase in scope.
They are insensitive to the scope or they neglect the scope, since the number has little effect on the willingness to pay.
This theory is called **scope insensitivity** or **scope neglect**.

A hypothesis for this phenomenon is the **valuation by prototype**.
People can visualize a single bird or lake, but not 10,000 or even more.
The image people create is the same and insensitive to the number of subjects.
As a result, the scope doesn't make any difference.

But there is also another hypothesis.
It is called **purchase of moral satisfaction**.
People do not try to spend enough money, but to achieve this nice feeling that arises, when we think we have done our duty.

To be an effective altruist, it is not done by visualizing only the prototype.
The numbers in total with all the zeroes have to be considered in your evaluation.
Only then, you are able to act rational.

### 2. The Martial Art of Rationality

In comparison to martial arts, it is not so easy to show how to be rational, how to use techniques of rationality.
While you can show how to make a fist right, you cannot show your thinking pattern.
But, in the last few decades, we found the Bayesian systematization of probability theory and statistics, experimental investigations of empirical human psychology, and many more.
All of them help us to understand our minds and make the muscles of our brains visible.
Furthermore, we share now a vocabulary to describe problems and solutions.
The martial arts of rationality might look like the following:

* **Apply** the science to our intuitions, to use the abstract knowledge to
* **correct** our mental movements and
* **augment** our metacognitive skills.

### 3. Availability

There is the so called **availability heuristic**, which describes the *frequency or probability of an event by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind.*
For example, people tend to think that murders are more common than suicides, because they hear more often of murders.
Media plays an important role, since selective reporting can lead to availability biases.
Another problem that occurs these days is that you are likely to compare yourself with people you will probably never meet.
Due to the Internet you hear more often of Bill Gates, but do you think you will ever meet him?
You should not use your memory to calculate the probability of events.

### 4. What's a Bias?

A bias is when our brain operates with a wrong thinking process.
It is not that we have learned facts that are just not right.
Those are called *mistakes*.
A bias is, for examples, the availability heuristic or the scope insensitivity.
We get information, but our thinking leads to a wrong conclusion.
These biases are obstacles in our way to the truth, so we should be aware of them and start to rethink and correct this thinking pattern.

### 5. Burdensome Details

When people rate the probability of "A and B" higher than only `*A* or *B*, it is called **conjunction fallacy**.
By adding a detail, an event sometimes seems to be *more* plausible and people judge it as *more* likely even though it is *less* likely.
To fight the conjunction fallacy one should start to really feel every added detail as a **burden**.
In addition, disentangling and judging every detail independently can help you to overcome the conjunction fallacy.

### 6. What Do I Mean By "Rationality"?

* **Epistemic Rationality**: systematically improving the accuracy of your beliefs

=> building accurate maps

* **Instrumental Rationality**: systematically achieving your values

=> art of choosing actions that lead to higher outcomes = "winning"

All in all one could say that **rationality is about forming true beliefs and making decisions that help you win**.
