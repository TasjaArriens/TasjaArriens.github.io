## Step I: D is for Definition

### Rules That Change the Rules

#### 1. Retirement is worst-case-scenario insurance.

#### 2. Interest and energy are cyclical.

#### 3. Less is not laziness.

#### 4. The timing is never right.

#### 5. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

#### 6. Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses.

#### 7. Things in excess become their opposite.

#### 8. Money alone is not the solution.

#### 9. Relative income is more important than absolute income.

#### 10. Distress is bad, eustress is good.

### Questions You Should Ask Yourself If You Have Doubts

1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering.

2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily?

3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios?

4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?

5. What are you putting off out of fear?

6. What is it costing you - financially, emotionally, and physically - to postpone action?

7. What are you waiting for?

### System Reset: Doing Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic

Call seemingly unreachable people, not because you won't get an answer.
It is because you have to overcome your own fear.
Reach for doing the unrealistic.
Try anything to get them to answer and see what happens.

The following questions are going to help you for dreamlining.

1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world?

Create 2 timelines and list **5 things** you dream of **having, being, and doing**.

2. Drawing a blank?

Before you tell everyone what is holding you back, first define what you are being held from.
What would you do if you had â‚¬100 million? 
What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day?

**Code:** Let's keep it to its length and let it not take the whole width.
{% highlight html %}

<div class="nav">
    <ul>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
        <li>Project</li>
    </ul>
</div>


{% endhighlight %}

This is a simple markdown table

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |



Use below code to show **Table of Contents** on a page

{% highlight css %}
* Do not remove this line (it will not be displayed) 
{:toc}
{% endhighlight %}
